    <!-- The Story Behind the Name Section -->
    <h2>The Story Behind the Name</h2>
    <p>The name "The Tangled Oak" is inspired by both the natural world and our roots here in North Bay. The oak tree, known for its strength and enduring presence, symbolizes stability, growth, and deep roots. The "tangled" part of the name reflects the creative, interconnected community we’ve fostered with local artisans and makers. It also pays homage to our location on Oak Street, where we bring together a variety of talents and passions to create something unique and beautiful.</p>
    <p>At The Tangled Oak + Craft Collective, we embrace the beauty of diversity and collaboration, much like the intertwining branches of an oak tree, and we strive to create a space where creativity and community thrive together.</p>
